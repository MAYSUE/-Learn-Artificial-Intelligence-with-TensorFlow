# Section 1: TensorFlow and Machine Learning Fundamentals

The code walkthroughs from the videos are all in the `notebooks` directory, with
one notebook for each video. The small snippets shown in the slides are in the python files, named by video.

To run the notebooks, make sure you've installed jupyter (`pip install jupyter`) and then launch as usual via `jupyter notebook`. Then, navigate (in your browser) to the notebook you'd like to run.
